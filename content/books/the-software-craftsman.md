<!-- Book written by Sandro Mancuso

## Short summary

Book is full on useful knowledge that every developer should know. Agile, TDD, SCRUM, XP (Extreme programing) and some other buzz words every of us know already.

A lot of content around topic "How not to work":

  - Free over-hours,
  - weekends in work
  - ~30+ hours crunch times to deliver some crappy software to met deadlines that will be moved anyway.

I must say, I was shocked to learn how our job looked back then.

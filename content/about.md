### Background

I am a young developer that just finished his Masters Degree and already has more than four years of experience. I was working with various technologies in different roles like FrontEnd Developer, System Engineer and finally as a Backend Programmer.

### Main focus

Right now I am focused on improving general programming skills with the help of courses, books and a lot of practice (with both, commercial and side projects).

### This site

I am using mainly **Go (Golang)** as I found this language to be most enjoyable to code in. I am treating this site as a place where I can store every little piece of knowledge I found cool enough to put online and save it for myself for later reuse. Apart from short TILs and longer tutorials, you can find out what books I read and think are valuable in our profession.

Hi! I am Olek and this is my personal blog site where I will share my ideas, projects, tutorials and other interesting (I hope so) stuff.

Right now I am trying to improve my **Go/Golang** skills, get some knowledge about **AWS** and get better in **vim** editor. I am trying to share what I learned to other people as I think it is the best way to consolidate the knowledge I gather. Also, it is a really great way to measure my own progress, as I can keep track of what I have learned so far.

Other places where you can find me ðŸ˜‰

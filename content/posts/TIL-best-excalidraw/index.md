# Today I Learned

Today I Learned that the best tool I ever used for drawing charts is open-source.

When I am working on my personal projects I like to create diagrams and schemes. It allows me to better understand what is the main problem I want to solve and how to do it. Additionally by following my thought process with writing I have the benefit of making it persistent.

I don't think this tool needs any explanation, just go and try it yourself by going to [excalidraw page](https://excalidraw.com/), it's free and does not require any registration.

## Collaboration

You can take your design process to the next level by live collaboration on one whiteboard with __Live collaboration__ feature. It works well, there is some minor latency issues sometimes, but overall it works great.

## VSCode extension

If you prefer to work in your editor and do not want to go to [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com/) every time, you can use great VSCode extension called [Excalidraw Schema Editor](https://github.com/pomdtr/vscode-excalidraw-embed).

You can keep your excalidraw files in git, edit in an inside editor and even compare two versions as you would normally do with other files.

## Summary

Excalidraw is a cool app you can use to share good looking diagrams with your colleagues. It is easy to operate and easy to collaborate on. Do not hesitate and start using it today.

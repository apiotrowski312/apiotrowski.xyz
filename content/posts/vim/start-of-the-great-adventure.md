![Vim-the-editor](/vim/vim-the-editor.jpg)

Hi! This is my very first blog post over here as I am starting my very first challenge that I would love to keep track of. The challenge is... Mastering Vim editor. When I firstly saw Vim I wasn't big fun of it, it felt unnecessary hard and clumsy. As I was working more and more with Linux servers I found out **Vim** is a a lot mor handy than **nano** so I learned some basic stuff, few shortcuts that made my life as a System Engineer easier. 

Days passed and then I saw that one Vim guy who was so fast with it. I was astonished how much cool stuff you can do with this editor, how fast you can do stuff. In that moment I knew I want to use vim like this too. And that is how I come up with this whole idea of vim challenge. 

## Vim challenge

I want to simply keep track of my progress while I am going deeper and deeper in the world of Vim. I would love to create some kind of guide or an tutorial series for anybody who is interested in Vim and would love to learn it just like I do. I will add new blog post from time to time which will cover every thing that I had learn. So basically I will write about shortcuts, plugins, helper applications etc. as I think it would be helpful, at least for me to go over it once more time.

## What's the plan?

First of all, to learn something I know I have to use it on my daily basis. That is why every new post in this blog will be written with power of Vim, also I will start with simple message bot for my Facebook account.

I did ditched messenger app long time ago, as I found it time consuming and pretty distracting. However, from time to time somebody write me there with important message (I don't get why would you use messenger to ask somebody about something urgent?!?!?), so I thought that it will be a great place to start my learning. 

I will build **Messenger bot** that will ask person who send me a message if this is urgent, if so, then Bot will send me a notification.

Sounds like cool little project I will be able to finish in couple of evening. I will do all programing in Go as I also want to develop in this language. I see a lot of good opportunities

## Current vim knowledge

My current vim knowledge is pretty limited to only simple command:

```bash
:wg - save and exit
dd - delete line
:X - go to line X
pp - paste
```

And that is basically it. Wish me luck guys and gals.

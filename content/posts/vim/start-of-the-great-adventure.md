![Vim-the-editor](/vim/vim-the-editor.jpg)

**Hi!** This is my very first blog post over here as I am starting my very first challenge, that I would love to keep track of. The challenge is... Mastering Vim editor. When I firstly saw Vim I wasn't a big fun of it, it felt unnecessarily hard and clumsy. As I was working more and more with Linux servers, I found out this tool is a lot more handy than e.g. nano, so I learned some basic Vim stuff, few shortcuts that made my life as a System Engineer easier. 

Days passed and then I saw that one Vim guy who was so fast with it. I was astonished how much cool stuff you can do with this editor, how fast you can do stuff. In that moment I knew I want to learn how to use vim like that. And that is how I came up with this whole idea of a vim challenge. 

## Vim challenge

I want to simply keep track of my progress while I am going deeper and deeper in the world of Vim. I would love to create some kind of guide or a tutorial series for anybody who is interested in Vim and would love to learn it just like I do. I will add new blog post from time to time which will cover everything that I had learned. So basically I will write about shortcuts, plugins, helper applications etc. as I think it would be helpful, at least for me to go over it one more time.

## What's the plan?

First of all, in order to learn something I know I have to use it on my daily basis. That is why every new post in this blog will be written with power of Vim, also I will start with a simple message bot for my Facebook account.

I did ditch the messenger app a long time ago, as I found it time consuming and pretty distracting. However, from time to time somebody's texting me there with an important message (I don't get why would you use messenger to ask somebody about something urgent?!?!?), so I thought that it will be a great place to start my learning. 

I will build the **Messenger bot** that will ask the person who sent me a message if it is urgent, if so, then the bot will send me a notification.

Sounds like a cool little project I will be able to finish in a couple of evenings. I will do all programming in Go as I also want to develop in this language. 

## Current vim knowledge

My current vim knowledge is pretty limited to simple command only:

```bash
dd - delete line
pp - paste line
A - go to the end of line and start interactive mode
e - go to end of next word
daw - delete current word
caw - delete current word and start interactive mode

:m 12 - move current line below line 12
:12 - go to line 12
:wq - save and exit

:set number - show row number on left
:set ruler - show row/column in the right bottom corner
```

And that is basically it. Wish me luck guys and gals.

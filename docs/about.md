# About me

## Background
Hello! I'm a developer from Poland with over seven years of experience in the IT industry. My professional journey began in 2017 while I was in my second year of Bachelor's studies. Since then, I've worked in various roles including Frontend Developer, System Engineer, and Backend Programmer. I also hold a Master's degree.

## Professional Journey
In recent years, I've focused on backend development, specializing in technologies like Golang, Microservices, and databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Additionally, I've gained experience in infrastructure management using tools like Terraform, and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP.

## Current Endeavors
Currently, I'm the Backend Tech Lead at Surfe, a tech company where we're redefining online content interaction. In my role, I lead a team of developers in building reliable backend solutions for our innovative products.

## Passion for Excellence
I'm passionate about software development and believe in the importance of Test Driven Development (TDD) for producing high-quality code. I'm committed to continual learning and improvement, both individually and through collaboration with peers.

## This Website
